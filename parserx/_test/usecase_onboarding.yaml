#    Given a frequent flyer user should be able to do a booking fly from our well known fly routes, selecting the
#    departure airport and the arrival airport, also setting up the from-to fly dates. If the booking is successful, so the
#    system should calculate the user awards and upgrade it following the rules below:
#
#        - IF the user.Plan is GOLD
#          AND the user accumulated miles (current user miles + trip.Miles) are greater than 1500
#          AND the trip.Miles are greater than 2000
#          THEN
#          user.Miles = current user miles + trip.Miles + 1000
#          ELSE
#          user.Miles = current user miles + trip.Miles + 200
#
#        - IF the user.Plan is SILVER
#          AND the user accumulated miles (current user miles + trip.Miles) are greater than 8000
#          THEN
#          user.Miles = current user miles + trip.Miles + 500
#          user.Plan = GOLD
#
#        - IF the user.Plan is BRONZE
#          AND the user accumulated miles (current user miles + trip.Miles) are greater than 4000
#          THEN
#          user.Miles = current user miles + trip.Miles + 300
#          user.Plan = SILVER
