The entity is the core component based on your entity schema. Torpedo generates an object class from your schema.
This class will contain the schema fields as class attributes and let you interact with these via **getter** and **setter** methods.

Additionally, the next attributes are added to the class:

| Field   | Type      | Description                                            |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| id      | string    | It is required and is configured as UUID or ULID       |
| created | timestamp | It is autogenerated and handled by the CRUD operations |
| updated | timestamp | It is autogenerated and handled by the CRUD operations |


## How Torpedo works with the Entity

Once that you have finished your entity schema and after generate your code, Torpedo will create 2 entity classes.
The `EntityBase` and the `Entity`. The first one is the class that contains the autogenerated code wit all CRUD operations 
and the _Query_ method. 

The `Entity` class will inherit from the `EntityBase` letting you add custom logic at `Entity` level. 

???+ Tip "Entity and EntityBase code generation"

    Each time that you run the code generator the `EntityBase` class will be overwriten, however the
    `Entity` class will be keep avoiding overwite your code.

## Sample: Author Entity

Having a Blog post website we define the post's author entity schema as:

```yaml
version: torpedo.darksub.io/v1.0
kind: entity
spec:
  name: "author"
  plural: "authors"
  description: "The blog post author"

  schema:
    reserved:
      # By default, an ID is assigned as ULID format (string).
      # the field name id is reserved, but you can configure it from this section
      id:
        type: ulid

    fields:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: "The author full name"
        doc: "The author full name"

      - name: email
        type: string
        description: "The author contact email"
        doc: "The author contact email"
```

Once that we have defined the Entity Schema and executed the torpedo command to generate the code. 
The outcome will be:

``` mermaid
classDiagram
  AuthorBase <|-- Author
  AuthorBase : String id
  AuthorBase : Int created
  AuthorBase : Int updated
  AuthorBase : String name
  AuthorBase : String email
  AuthorBase: +GetId()
  AuthorBase: +GetCreated()
  AuthorBase: +GetUpdated()
  AuthorBase: +SetName(String name)
  AuthorBase: +GetName()
  AuthorBase: +SetEmail(String email)
  AuthorBase: +GetEmail()
```

!!! danger "As developer"

    As a developer your own business logic **MUST BE** written into the Author class in order to avoid
    that Torpedo code generation tool overwrite your code!
    
    We strongly recommend write your uses cases into the Service class and not as part of the Entity.
    The Entity object let you expands your data model adding new fields that are not supported by Torpedo.
